My first little programme.  A smile sample/drum machine type thingy

I write this in Septermber 2023.  This is my first attempt at a piece of audio software.  It's a simple sample loader/drum machine type VST3 that allows
the user to load up to 9 samples.  These a triggered form the MIDI keyboard.  Samples load from middle C upwards. 

Still a few bugs but i'm learning.
